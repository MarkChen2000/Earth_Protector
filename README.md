This is a mobile Unity game project called Earth Protector.
This project is a reather small project, because that I want to decrease the develop time and target to pubulish to store quickly.

The game is a game that designed for mobile phone screen. 
Player have to touch the screen to shoot meteors that come from outside of screen to protect earth.
There are some features like: flying track of meteors is influenced by gravity of earth, every kinds of meteors have different mass and speed.
